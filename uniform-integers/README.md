# Uniform Integers â€“ Meta Puzzle

This puzzle comes from Meta's official interview question set.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary

A positive integer is called **uniform** if all its digits are the same.  
Examples: `1`, `22`, `333`, `9999` â€” all uniform.  
In contrast, `23` or `121` are not.

**Goal:**  
Given two integers `A` and `B`, determine how many **uniform integers** exist in the inclusive range `[A, B]`.

## ðŸ§  Solution Summary

### Explanation

We do **not** check each number from `A` to `B`.  
Instead, we **generate only uniform integers** like `1`, `11`, `222`, etc., and count those that fall within `[A, B]`.

Steps:
- Loop through digit lengths from `len(str(A))` to `len(str(B))`
- For each digit (1 to 9), form a uniform number like `digit * length`
- Count how many fall into the given range

### Why Itâ€™s Efficient:
Only ~108 uniform integers exist in total (`9 digits Ã— 12 lengths`),  
so the solution runs instantly even for huge ranges.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(1)** practically â€” bounded by constant iterations
- No iteration over range `[A, B]`

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)** auxiliary
