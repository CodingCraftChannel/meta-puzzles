This puzzle comes from Meta's official interview question set.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary

You are at a Kaitenzushi restaurant with a row of `N` dishes passing one by one on a belt.  
Each dish has a type `D[i]`. You love variety and will only eat a dish if you havenâ€™t eaten the same type in the last `K` dishes.

> You eat each eligible dish instantly before the next one arrives.

**Goal:**  
Determine the **maximum number of dishes** you will eat â€” while never repeating the same dish type within the last `K` eaten dishes.

## ðŸ”’ Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 500,000`  
- `1 â‰¤ K â‰¤ N`  
- `1 â‰¤ D[i] â‰¤ 1,000,000`

## ðŸ§  Solution Summary

### Explanation

To avoid eating the same type within the last `K` dishes, we need to:
- Track the **types of the last `K` eaten dishes**
- For each new dish:
  - If itâ€™s not in the recent list, eat it and update memory
  - Otherwise, skip it

We use:
- A `queue` to keep the order of recently eaten dishes
- A `set` to check for duplicates in O(1)

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N)** â€” one pass through the list, constant-time updates

### Space Complexity:
- **O(K)** for the queue and set used to track recent dish types
